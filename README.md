# Midterm-Takehome

Using the Processing PDE, write an interactive program to meet the specifications given below.  
Submit your code via your Github account as a new file named  __"midterm-yourname.java"__   
  _where **yourname** is (at least three letters of) **your own** last name._

Begin with comment lines that state the purpose of your code and also state the name of the author (which should be YOU), and include lines that display YOUR name on the screen when the code is executed.
Be sure to employ good software techniques to ensure "readability" of your code.  
Most importantly:  be sure that YOU understand every single line of the code that you submit.
(Do not copy and past any code from anyone else's code on GitHub.)

Before submitting your code, make sure it compiles runs on **Processing**.  
    *(Code with syntax errors will not be graded!)*

The ``draw()`` method should create each frame containing the by following features:
* Display a "scene" consisting of light-blue sky overhead and dark green water below.
* A red boat goes back and forth on the surface of the water.
* a large (Tuna) fish swims within the water.
* A bottom-dwelling "crawler" lurks below.  

Event handlers (such as ```mousePressed()``` and ```keyPressed()```
should provide dynamic action, as follows.
* When the boat is clicked (or the 'b' key is pressed, it "goes fishing" and catches any fish that is directly below it.
* When the crawler is clicked (or the 'c' key is pressed, it "goes hunting" and catches any fish that is directly below it.
