# Midterm-Takehome

Using the Processing PDE, write an interactive program to meet the following specifications.  
Submit your code via your Github account as a new file named  __"midterm-yourname.java"__   
  _where '''yourname''' is (at least three letters of) __your own__ last name._

Before submitting your code, make sure it compiles properly on **Processing**.  
    *(Code with syntax errors will not be graded!)*  
Be sure to employ good software techniques to ensure "readability" of your code.
