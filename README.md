# Midterm-Takehome

Using the Processing PDE, write an interactive program to meet the following specifications.  
Submit your code via your Github account as a new file named  __"midterm-yourname.java"__   
  _where **yourname** is (at least three letters of) **your own** last name._

Begin with comment lines that state the purpose of your code and also state the name of the author (which should be YOU), and include lines that display your name on the screen when the code is executed.
Be sure to employ good software techniques to ensure "readability" of your code.
Most importantly:  be sure that YOU nderstand every single line of the code that you submit.

Before submitting your code, make sure it compiles properly on **Processing**.  
    *(Code with syntax errors will not be graded!)*
